          <b>Swami Vivekanand Students Welfare Charitable Trust</b> was established on <b>June 10, 1996, by Kumari Basanti Manihar</b>
		  with the aim of fostering the holistic development of underprivileged girl students. 
		  <b>Shri Nandkishore Sharda</b> served as the <b>first President</b> from its inception until his passing on <b>January 24, 2003.</b> 
		  <b>Kumari Basanti Manihar</b> then assumed the <b>role of President</b>, continuing in this capacity until her demise in <b>May 2021.</b> 
		  </p><p><b>Since May 27, 2021, Kumari Madhubala Advani has been leading the Trust as its President.</b>
		</p>
		<p>	
		  This trust, which is very special and unique in itself, is committed towards the holistic development of the girl child. 
		  Generally, all trusts accept the fulfillment of their duty by giving only financial assistance. 
		  The specialty of this trust is that apart from providing financial support, it is always available for guidance and help the girl students.
        </p>
		<p>
		Shardaji was a great thinker, a sage, a visionary and a prophetic spiritual person.  
		His thinking was original, scientific and based on the characteristics and need of the present era. 
		He firmly believed that education is a natural right of every person, especially the girl child. 
		All beneficiary girls of the trust are members of the family of Divine Mother Maa Jagatjanani; 
		financial assistance is their right, not a favor or charity
		</p>

	<p>
		  One of the specialties of this trust is that the scholarship is provided to the girl students on the basis of need only 
		  and not on the basis of merit. Over a period of time, under the guidance of the trust members, 
		  the academic level of these girl students increases tremendously and a few students even get into the merit list.

			Shri Sharda was always very careful to ensure that the self-respect and dignity of every girl child was maintained. 
			Here special importance is given to the overall development of every girl child. 
			Intensive efforts are made to create interest and curiosity towards their studies, and concentration and dedication towards their goal. 
			To fulfill this objective, the seeds of Indian culture and human values are sown in them during their school education. 
			The purpose is 'Catch them young' because their mind at this tender age is like soft clay which can be moulded into the desired form

		<p>
        In the Personality Development Classes, the girl students are taught how to make their goals, understand them and finally implement them 
		on the basis of <i>‘Buddhi Vivek Yog Sadhna’</i> developed by Gyanyogi Shri Nandkishore Sharda. This makes these girls stand out in crowd 
		and build their own unique identity oozing in confidence which is helpful for their progress in every walk of life. 
		They develop right decision making ability based on cordiality, harmony and self-discretion, which is rare in the present era. 
		Their life becomes full of happiness and cheerfulness. They are made aware of their rights as well as duties so that 
		they become Samaritan citizens and are able to contribute in the development of family, society and nation. 
		This is a positive concrete step towards girl/women empowerment.
