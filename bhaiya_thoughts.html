  <h2>What made Nandkishore Ji think about Girls/Women Empowerment</h2>
  <p>
   About two decades ago, in India, particularly Western Rajasthan, it was a daydream for girls to get education in uneducated 
   and son-obsessed families battling poverty and unemployment. The plight of government schools with dilapidated buildings, 
   broken furniture, inadequate drinking water and toilet facilities and with girl students sitting on floor on sackcloth even in winters, 
   made the situation even more pathetic. In such circumstances, when there was nobody to even think about the plight of these girls, 
   Shri Nandkishore Ji Sharda (who was affectionately called 'Bhaiya' by all) started a movement for the upliftment of these helpless and 
   resourceless girls struggling in dire conditions. Bhaiya Shri Nandkishore Sharda analyzed that education of girls along with inculcation of ‘Sankars’ in them was a must for the upliftment 
  of the society.  
   </p>
  <p><b> Only an educated girl would become a skilled and well-educated housewife, become an ideal mother and be able to eradicate 
  many evils of the society.</p></b> 
  <h2>Girls Empowerment - Foundation</h2>
  <p>
  In 1995, he analyzed the fundamental reforms needed in the then current education system, and stressed the need to make education 
  and ‘sanskar’ (ethical and moral values) complement to each other. He was of the opinion that if ‘sanskar’ is included in the education system, 
  then we will be able to take the first right step towards women empowerment. 
  It is an unwithering/everlasting/ technique appropriate in all the times, places and circumstances. </p>

  <p>Bhaiya Shri Nandkishore Sharda contemplated that if only bookish knowledge, which is devoid of ‘sanskar, is given to these girls, 
  then these educated girls may become arrogant. They would only think of their rights and become completely indifferent towards their duties. 
  Therefore, it is utmost necessary that ‘sanskars’ be imparted to them along with education, so that they become well-educated, well-mannered, 
  well-cultured, modest, sensitive, self-confident and self-respecting human beings and 
  contribute towards the development of family, society and the nation. 
  Besides, they should be made to learn vocational skills including sewing skills and computer skills so that they become financially self-reliant.

      <h2>Girls Empowerment - First Step</h2>
      <p>
To give shape to these objectives, the <b><i>Swami Vivekananda Students Welfare Charitable Trust</b></i> was established on June 10, 1996 
by Maa Basanti Manihar through the divine ordinance of Maa Tripurasundari. Shri Nandkishore Sharda shouldered the responsibility of its President.
This way the trust started working for the benefit of the school girls and Bhaiya Shri Nandkishore Sharda, as its President, 
gave a concrete form to his thinking and functioning/working style through the working of the trust.
This effort of Shri Nandkishore Sharda was the first concrete step towards "Girl empowerment". 
He was of the firm belief that the empowerment of the girl child would automatically become the basis of ‘women empowerment’ in future. 
<br><b>Bhaiya Shri Nandkishore Sharda contemplated this at a time when ‘women empowerment’ was unheard of in society.</b>
