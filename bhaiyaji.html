          <b>“When Jagatjanani Maa Tripurasundari blessed me with her divine vision, I ran and prostrated on her feet”</b> – 
		  these words are written in the handwritten diary of an 18- year-old youth, which he started writing at the tender age of 12. 
		  After reading this, this curiosity must have arisen in your mind that in this materialistic era, who can be such a young man who has blessed 
		  with the divine vision of Divine Mother? The name of this highly revered young man is <b>Nandkishore Sharda</b>.
        </p>
		
    <p>
      <b>Shri Nandkishore Sharda</b> , who was affectionately called <i>'Bhaiya ji'</i> by all, was born on <b>July 16, 1944</b>, in Jodhpur, 
	  in the affluent and devotional family of Smt. Tulsi Devi and Shri Vijaykishan Ji Sharda. 
	  Shri Sharda was a brilliant student of science. He possessed extraordinary intellect and a charismatic personality.

       <p>
      In 1959, when Shri Nandkishoree Sharda was only 15 years old, the sudden demise of his father deeply perturbed him and 
	  he realized the mortality of this physical body. At that very instant, he resolved that he would abstain from all attractions of 
	  the materialistic world and search the cosmic power that drives/governs this physical body for so many years viz. 
	  What is that power? How does it run the physical body? 
	  What is the purpose of human life? How should one lead one’s life?

      He went to many sadhus, ‘tantriks’, saints and mahatmas in search of his quest. He also read various spiritual and religious books but 
	  could not get any satisfactory answer anywhere. Once, when he was strolling in the valleys near the fort of Jodhpur, 
	  he saw a temple of the Divine Mother on the top of a <b>hillock (Tekri)</b>. When he climbed and entered the temple, he felt great peace and tranquility.
	  He then completely surrendered and devoted himself to the Divine Mother and solemnly worshiped her day and night with full dedication. 
	  The Divine Mother could not keep herself away from this simple, innocent child and blessed him with her divine vision. 
	  The Divine Mother bestowed many divine powers upon her beloved son which were later used by him for the welfare of the masses.
    </p>
	<p>
	<b>Bhaiya ji himself performed very austere penance (sadhna) but showed us the simple path.</b>
	If we perform ‘sadhna’ with devotion, faith, love and dedication, then Bhaiya ji would unite us also with the Divine Mother.

	<p>Through his utmost dedication, sincerity, truthfulness, renunciation and single mindedness, Shri Nandkishore ji Sharda mastered all the 
		four extremely difficult sadhnas <br>– <b><i>Bhakti Yoga, Gyan Yoga, Nishkam Karma Yoga and Yoga Sadhana</b></i>. 
		<br>However, he realized that all 
		these sadhnas are very difficult to be implemented by the common masses in today's era. </p>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Therefore, for the welfare of the masses, he simplified 
		and combined these four sadhnas and propounded a simple,contemporary, yet very effective technique, called <b><i>'Buddhi-Vivek Yoga Sadhana'</b></i> 
		for material and spiritual progress and attaining real happiness, peace and bliss. Bhaiyaji's contribution to mankind is extraordinary in itself and unmatched 
		in this era. As per the needs of the present era, he gave new ideology, new technique, new divine knowledge in the field of physical (materialism), 
		social and spiritual. Consequently, a team of such people is getting prepared who are determined and dedicated to restore human qualities.
