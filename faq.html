          Swami Vivekananda Student’s Welfare Charitable Trust is only for girl students. In 2009, some girl students requested that their brothers' education is being hampered due to financial reasons. At the same time, the members of the trust also realized that many male students in the society are not able to pursue their studies due to financial constraints. To cater to this problem, “Shri Nandkishore Sharda Adhyatma Kendra” was established in 2010. Since then, the male students are also getting financial assistance from this trust.

          Any person can financially contribute to this great cause of women empowerment. Apart from this, one can also contribute through one’s honorary/selfless services and time. The promotion and propagation of the thoughts of Bhaiya Shri Nandkishore Sharda's on women empowerment is yet another way to contribute to this noble cause.
