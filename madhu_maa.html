          A carefree nineteen year old girl was living her life being happy in small pleasures and sad in small sorrows when suddenly Maa Basanti ji 
		  smilingly placed her blessings on her in the form of "Maa Saraswati". Gave and paved her spiritual path. Her first meeting with Maa Basanti 
		  happened suddenly in a hospital. From there, seeing her virtuous thoughts and sincere behavior towards her mother, 
		  she was deeply impressed by her and remained a part of the “Maa Parivaar”.

          <b>Madhubala ji Advani’s (Madhu Maa)</b> arrival in the 'Maa Parivaar' took place in <b>1970</b>. As a B.Sc. student, 19 year old, Madhu Maa (M.A., B.Ed.) 
		  met Maa Basanti ji for the first time in a hospital, where incidentally, their mothers were undergoing treatment. At the very first glance, 
		  Maa Basanti ji, through her divine vision, could feel that Madhu Maa was her eternal companion. Madhu Maa was also so impressed by 
		  Maa Basanti ji's virtuous thoughts and her complete dedication towards Jagatjanani Maa that eventually, she too became a part of the “Maa Parivaar”.
		  Later on, Bhaiya Shri Nandksihore ji Sharda also became her spiritual mentor. <b>For the last 50 years, 
		  she is performing spiritual practice (sadhna) under the guidance of Maa Basanti ji Manihar and Bhaiya Shri Nandkishore ji Sharda</b>
