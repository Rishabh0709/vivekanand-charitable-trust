          Shri Nandkishoree Sharda ,who was affectionately called 'Bhaiyya' by all, was born on July 16, 1944, in Jodhpur, 
		  in the affluent and devotional family of Smt. Tulsi Devi and Shri Vijaykishan Ji Sharda. 
		  Shri Sharda was a brilliant student of science. He possessed extraordinary intellect and a charismatic/majestic personality..

      <p>
        Shri Nandkishoree Sharda was only 15 years old in 1959 when the sudden demise of his father deeply perturbed him 
		and he realized the mortality/perishability of this physical body. 
		At that very instant, he resolved that he would abstain from all attractions of the materialistic world and 
		would search the cosmic power that drives/runs/sustains this physical body for so many years; 
		what is that power? how does it runs the physical body? what is the purpose of human life? how should one lead his life? 
      </p>
      <p>
        He went to many sadhus, tantiks, mantriks, saints, mahatmas in search of his quest. 
		He also read various spiritual and religious books but he could not get any satisfactory answers anywhere. 
		Once, he was strolling in the valleys near the fort of Jodhpur, when he saw a temple on the top of a hill (Tekri). 
		When he climbed and the reached the temple, he felt great peace and tranquility. 
		He then surrendered himself onto the lotus feet of the Divine Mother and made her the mother of even his physical body. 
		He devoted himself completely to the Divine Mother and worshiped her solemnly day and night intensely. 
		The Divine Mother could not keep herself away from this simple, innocent child and blessed him with her divine vision. 
		Bhaiya ji prostrated onto the lotus feet of the Divine Mother. The Divine Mother bestowed many divine powers upon her beloved son. 
		Bhaiya and the Divine Mother became one.

        <p>
          Bhaiya ji himself performed very austere penance but showed us the simple path. told us the easy way. 
		  If we perform ‘sadhna’ with devotion, faith, love and dedication, then only Bhaiya would unite us with the Divine Mother. 
		  Bhaiya ji performed divine ‘sadhna’ of highest order under the guidance and supervision of the Divine Mother. 
		  The divine ambrosial knowledge that he received from the Divine Mother and 
		  his own divine experiences have been presented in the divine book “Wonderful World After Death”. 
		  Starting from science and going beyond the realm of science, he has explained the origin and formation of the universe, 
		  the divine abodes, God’s kingdom, goal of human life, importance of sentient power, etc. in this book which increases one’s trust 
		  and faith in the Almighty and divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The personality and accomplishments/work of Bhaiyaji are described in detail in the book
		  “Mother Tripurasundari Ke Laadla Chakradhari Yuga Pravartak Adhyatmayogi Shri Nandkishore Sharda”. 
		  This book also includes a few pages of his handwritten diary which deeply reflects his devotion towards the Divine Mother, 
		  his philosophical thoughts, and the divine knowledge and experiences gained through the Divine Mother.
