    Shri Nandkishore Sharda's intense thinking and contemplation led to a methodology for uplifting needy girl students, 
	addressing not just financial support but also their values, confidence, and holistic well-being.
  </div>
 <div class="container-modus">

    <h2 class="section-heading">1. Motivating Speeches & Distribution of Inspirational Books</h2>
    <div class="section">

	</div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
      His motivating and encouraging speeches infused enthusiasm, exuberance, and energy in the students. 
	  This helped them imbibe human values and build awareness of the importance of education, leading them to brighten their futures, 
	  become good citizens, and attain financial capability. Inspired graduates support the younger sisters coming to the trust, 
	  keeping the flame of knowledge alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sow the seeds of human values and character (beyond academics), the trust distributed about 90,000 inspirational books 
	  (biographies and teachings of great men) free of cost in schools. Bhaiya ji also provided financial support not just to girl students,
	  but also to their needy families.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">2. Inspiring Interest in Education</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
       <p>
      Bhaiya ji inspired girls towards education and developed their interest—especially for those who were previously indifferent. 
	  In today’s competitive era, passing exams alone isn’t enough; in-depth knowledge leads to success. 
	  He quoted the teachings of Swami Vivekananda, Lord Ramakrishna, and Maa Shardamani, constantly motivating girls by reminding them that, 
	  as daughters of Goddess Bhagwati, they have unlimited potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participation and inspiration extended to meetings with parents and teachers, 
	  helping ensure girls are supported both at home and at school—a holistic approach that greatly benefitted their academic progress and future.

    <h2 class="section-heading">3. Development of Core Values & Resolutions</h2>
    <div class="section">

      <img src="/assets/images/f6.jpg" alt="Sanskar classes" />
	 </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
      To develop core values, Bhaiya ji encouraged three daily resolutions among the students:
      <ol>
        <li>Pray selflessly with reverence for at least 10 minutes daily.</li>
        <li>Move towards their academic goals with single-minded focus.</li>
        <li>When capable, contribute to the Trust’s <i>‘Gyan Yagna’</i> (Knowledge Campaign).</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Selfless prayer led students to greater purity of mind and intellect, joy, peace, and happiness. 
	  High moral character and values—such as compassion, tolerance, positivity, and gratitude towards God and Nature—were thus developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1998, Bhaiya ji launched <b><i>"Sunday Sanskar Seminars"</b></i> to boost interest in studies and instill good values. 
	  These seminars promoted friendship and mutual help among the girls. 
	  Their enthusiastic participation built unity and focus on academic achievement, with support from the Trust’s team and key school principals.

    <h2 class="section-heading">4. Promoting Mental & Intellectual Health</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <div class="text">
        Bhaiya ji emphasized the importance of mental and intellectual health alongside physical well-being, 
		introducing <b><i>“Intellect-Discretion Yoga Sadhana” (Buddhi Vivek Yog Sadhna)</b></i> to awaken and refine girls’ minds and intellects, 
		preparing them to thrive and take their rightful place in modern society.
