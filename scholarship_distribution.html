      <h2>How We Started</h2>
      <p>
        At the time when <b>'Swami Vivekanand Students Welfare Charitable Trust'</b> was established in the <b>year 1996</b>, the <b>fee in government schools was 
		only 110 rupees</b>. Despite this, <b>every year 300 to 400 girl students were dropping out of school due to lack of money</b>. 
	</p>		
		<p>When Bhaiyaji examined this situation, he found that there were many families having five to six school going children and 
		their father's livelihood was so meagre that he could not raise even <b>500-600 rupees at one go</b> in the month of July. 
		Consequently, the elder sisters had to drop school after their primary education. 
		<b>Bhaiyaji resolved that if any girl student from a government school fills the application form of the trust, she would continue to 
		get scholarship for as long as she wishes to study. Lack of money shall not hinder her education.</b> 
		Bhaiyaji secured the future of all the needy girls of all Government schools of Jodhpur 
		(Secondary and Senior Secondary) by providing them financial assistance, so that they could complete their education smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the year 2000, the state government waived the school fee of all the girls of the government schools and also provided them free textbooks. 
		However, the students from class IX to XII had to pay the computer and development fee. Since then, <b>the trust adopts the 
		needy girl students of classes IX to XII and reimburses their board fees along with computer and development fees.</b>
      </p>
	  <p>
	  Bhaiyaji realized that school education alone will not be not enough for the all-round development of girl students. 
	  So he founded the <b>Maa Sharda Mani Trust and Book Bank in the year 2001</b> 
	  to provide <b>scholarships and textbooks for higher education to desirous students.</b> 
	  </p>
    </section>
	<div>
	<h2>Where We Are</h2>
	<p>The seed of girl education which was sown in <b>1996</b> in the form of <b>Swami Vivekanand Students' Welfare Charitable Trust</b> 
	with <b>300 girl students and scholarships of one lakh rupees</b> has become a gigantic tree today. 
	Since its inception in <b>1996, scholarships of 3.96 crore rupees has been provided to 35332 girl students</b>.
	<br>We supports <b>students across 45 schools and 32 colleges</b> located in Jodhpur, Barmer, and other districts to ensure wide educational outreach.

	<h2>How Trust's Support Helped Girls</h2>
	<p>
	By getting benefited from the trust, girls are now becoming financially self-sufficient by earning professional degrees like 
	<b>Ph.D., CA, Engineering, MBA, MCA, B.Ed</b> etc. By standing on her feet and beaming with confidence, <b>she is also providing financial support to 
	her family.</b> </p>
	<p><b>Due to the qualities/virtues nurtured by the Trust</b>, she is not only living her life happily but also spreading the fragrance 
	of her qualities in her family. After marriage, she is turning into a/an balanced/excellent wife, leading a happy and peaceful life and is
	also proving a good mother by imbibing and nurturing good human values in her children.</p>
	<p>The atmosphere of dissatisfaction and disharmony in her family viz. being angry 
	over small things, irritability, unrest etc. has been replaced by joy, happiness, mutual harmony and tolerance.
