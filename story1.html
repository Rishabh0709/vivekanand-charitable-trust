	<p>
	I received support from the <b>Swami Vivekanand Students Welfare Charitable Trust</b> for my education from <b>9th class (1998)</b> through to 
	the completion of my <b>M.Com. in 2007.</b> 
	I am deeply grateful to the Trust for standing by me during one of the most challenging periods of my life—after the loss of my father.
	</p>
     <p>
	 At that time, continuing my education seemed impossible. Our family was going through an emotionally and financially difficult phase, and had it not been for the timely support from the Trust, I would not have been able to pursue my studies. 
	 The education I received during those crucial years not only shaped my career but also helped me earn a <b>dignified place in society.</b>
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Since <b>2008</b>, I have been working at <b>State Bank of India (SBI)</b>, and I am currently serving as a Customer Assistant. 
	 The values and guidance imparted to me—especially by <b>Maa Basanti Manihar</b>, the Founder and President of the Trust—have had a lasting impact on my life. 
	 Her wisdom and support have also helped me build and maintain a <b>happy and peaceful married life.</b>
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 As a humble gesture of gratitude, I regularly contribute financially to the Trust. 
	 It is my way of giving back to the institution that helped shape my future and continues to uplift many others.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 I extend my heartfelt thanks and warm regards to <b>Maa Basanti Manihar and Maa Madhubala Advani</b> for their tireless dedication and for making such a positive difference in the lives of countless girls. 
	 Their unwavering support and guidance have been instrumental in shaping many futures, including mine.
