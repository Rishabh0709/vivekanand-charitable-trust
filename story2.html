        I became a part of the <b>Swami Vivekanand Students Welfare Charitable Trust</b> in <b>1998</b>, while studying in <b>Class 6</b>.
        From that point until the completion of my <b>M.Sc. in 2010</b>, the Trust generously supported all my educational expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        As one of four siblings in a financially struggling household, our situation became especially challenging when my father lost his job
        due to the closure of the Alcobex Factory in Jodhpur. Managing even basic household needs and rent became a daily struggle, and
        continuing our education seemed out of reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that crucial juncture, the Trust became a beacon of hope. Their timely intervention not only lifted the financial burden but also
        instilled in me the confidence and determination to pursue my academic goals with renewed dedication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I am honored to serve as the <b>Principal of Wisdom International School</b> in Bhagat Ki Kothi, Jodhpur. This milestone in my
        life would not have been possible without the unwavering support and visionary guidance of <b>Maa Basanti Manihar</b>, the Founder
        and President of the Trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am equally thankful to <b>Shri Nandkishore Ji Sharda</b> and <b>Maa Madhubala Advani</b> for their encouragement and support
        throughout my journey. Their belief in me helped transform my aspirations into reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will always remain deeply grateful to the Trust for shaping not just my career, but my character and values. It is because of their
        selfless service that I now have the opportunity to give back and contribute to society.
