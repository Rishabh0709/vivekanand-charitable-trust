    I have been associated with the <b>Swami Vivekanand Student Welfare Charitable Trust</b> for the past <b>13 years</b>, 
	and I truly consider it a privilege and blessing to be part of such a noble and spiritually enriching institution. 
	The Trust has not only guided me on the path of spiritual and personal development 
	but also helped me balance life’s materialistic needs with inner growth and peace.
	<p>
	Looking back, I was always sincere about my studies. However, in 2010, during my 12th standard, I lost my father. 
	His sudden demise shook our family, both emotionally and financially. Coming from a humble, middle-class background, 
	I was devastated and fell into depression. Continuing my education seemed almost impossible.
	</p>
	<p>
	At that low point in my life, someone recommended that I approach the Trust at <b>Manidweep, Shastri Nagar, Jodhpur,</b> for support. 
	That moment marked a true turning point in my journey.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Maa Basanti Manihar</b>, the then President of the Trust, did not just extend financial help—she became a guiding light in my life. 
	Through her compassion and mentorship, I learned how to live with purpose, strength, and joy. Every Sunday morning, the Trust 
	organizes <b><i>free Personality Development and Sanskar classes</b></i> for college girls, and it was in these classes that my transformation began.</p>
	<p>
	At the Trust, we weren’t just taught how to study—we were taught how to live: how to stay calm and composed, how to manage emotions like anger, 
	and how to nurture a healthy and meaningful life. 
	We were also given simple yet impactful health tips—like the importance of drinking enough water, getting fresh air, and absorbing sunlight.
	</p>
	<p>
	The girl who once struggled with depression and hopelessness found a new lease on life. My focus improved, my mind calmed, and happiness returned. 
	With renewed strength, I pursued my dreams—and in 2016, I proudly qualified as a <b>Chartered Accountant (CA) and Company Secretary (CS).</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	I began my career as an <b>Internal Auditor</b> at Mehrangarh Fort Trust in December 2016. 
	Since July 2018, I have been practicing as a CA with Soni Arora & Co. The selfless support and unwavering guidance of <b>Maa Basanti Manihar and 
	other Trust members</b> have been the foundation of my success—like an escalator lifting me up when I had no strength to climb.
	</p> 
	<p>Today, I am a more confident, joyful, and independent person. On behalf of myself and the countless other girls whose lives 
	have been transformed, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Maa Basanti Manihar and all the dedicated members of the Trust. 
	You have shaped not only my career but also my character and my life.
	</p>
	Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
