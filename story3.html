    I have been connected to Swami Vivekanand Student Welfare Charitable Trust since around last 13 years. 
	I feel privileged and lucky to be part of such a great spiritual institute which preaches us to the path of salvation following the 
	worldâ€™s materialistic but needful things.
	<p>
	Looking to my past, I had been very keen towards studies. However, after the <b>demise of my father during my 12th standard in 2010</b>, 
	it became very difficult for me to carry on with my studies. Since I belonged to a poor middle class family, I lost almost all my hope and 
	belief and fell into depression. At that time, someone suggested me <b>for this Trust, at Manidweep, Shastri-Nagar, Jodhpur,</b> for financial help. 
	Here the turning point of my life started.
	</p>
	<p>
	Maa Basanti Manihar, the President of the trust during that time, not only helped me financially to carry out my studies, 
	but also taught me how to live life. <b>On every Sunday morning, personality development and Sanskar classes are conducted for college girls 
	free of cost.</b> </p>
	<p>
	Here, not only they taught how to study, but also taught how to remain happy and calm; 
	how to control anger and such behavioral and spiritual things to assist them to develop overall in life. 
	Also tips are provided for healthy life viz. drinking plenty of water, inhaling fresh oxygen, taking sunlight, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
	I, who was depressed, hopeless and full of anger earlier, <b>had changed completely after attending such classes.</b> 
	I forgot anger, started living my life happily and my concentration towards study also increased. 
	<b>The result of which is myself here as Chartered Accountant (CA) and Company Secretary (CS) in 2016.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	"My first job was at Mehrangarh Fort Trust where I worked as Internal Auditor from Dec. 2016. 
	Since July 2018, I am practicing as a CA in Soni Arora & Co. 
	<b>The selfless support and guidance of Maa Basanti Manihar and other members of the trust had become escalator for my success.</b>
Today, I am more confident, more happy and self dependent person. 
<br><b>I, hereby, thank Maa Basanti Manihar and all members of the trust on behalf of thousands of girls like me who have been supported in their studies, career, social and professional lives.</b>
