    <h2>How Trust Selects Student</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>School Girls:</b>
        <br>The selection of needy students is made by class teachers from application forms recommended by the Principal to the trust.<br>
        School fees, board fees, and scholarships are paid via cheques directly to the school, and funds are distributed among students in the presence of higher education officials.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>College / Competitive Exams:</b>
        <br>After school, trust volunteers connect individually (postcard/call) to understand the student’s future plans, provide career guidance, and offer full or partial scholarship support as needed.
