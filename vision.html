    <h1>Vision And Mission Of This Trust</h1>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <p>
       The foremost principle of this trust is that no girl student should be deprived of the right to education due to want of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        This trust inspires their moral, intellectual, economic and social development leading to self-reliance and eventually turning them 
		into excellent citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no discrimination on the basis of caste, creed and religion. 
<br><b><i>“Sarvajan Hitay Sarvajan Sukhay”</b></i><br> i.e. Welfare of all, Prosperity for all  is the underlying theme. 
      </p>
	  <p>
	  Complete prudency is followed in the operation of the trust. The entire administrative expenditure of the trust is voluntarily 
	  borne by the Trustees. This means that the entire income of the Trust is exclusively used for distributing scholarship to the needy girls, 
	  and is not used for any other head. <br><b>As a result, only those people join the trust who really mean service.</b>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The financial support received by this trust in the form of donations is deposited in ‘Fixed Deposits’ in the banks, 
	  and only the interest accrued from it is distributed to the students in the form of scholarships.
